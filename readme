This module lets you fetch a list of devices, get info on those devices, as
well as mount, unmount, allocate, deallocate, and initialize devices.

perl Makefile.pl
mms
mms test

to build and test the extension. If it tests OK, then

mms install

to install it.

This beta release only has the device list, device info, allocate, and
deallocate functions implemented. (as well as some basic list functions,
but they're not that interesting)
