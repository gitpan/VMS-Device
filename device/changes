Revision history for Perl extension VMS::Device.

0.01  Thu May 21 12:05:22 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.01  Tue May 26 16:48:34 1998
    - All the items for device_info are in, along with appropriate bitmap
      decodes for them.

0.01  Tue May 26 22:54:04 1998 (Or too damn late)
    - Added device_list (sans special hash) and decode_device_bitmap

0.01  Wed May 27 13:45:23 1998
    - Changed device_list--no special hash. Now just takes two extra
      parameters.
    - Added device_classes and device_types functions. 

0.02  Wed May 27 17:03:32 1998
    - Added allocate and deallocate functions. Keen!

0.02  Thu May 28 11:32:34 1998
    - Fixed the example for total free blocks
    - #ifdef'd all the device types and classes. (Yay, perl! :) Should
      function much better on non-alpha non-7.1 systems.

0.03  Mon Sep 28 10:48:43 1998
    - Quick fix to the $GETDVIW call--I was leaving off an optional
      trailing parameter, and it bites folks on some platforms
    - Added in #ifdefs for all the $GETDVI items. I think they're all valid
      on all versions of VMS, but it can't hurt to be careful.

0.04  Mon Sep 28 15:50:12 1998
    - Added in code for initialize()

0.05  Wed Sep 30 20:36:12 1998
    - Added code for mount() and, after way too long a struggle, got it
      working. Now module's completely implemented, though error checking
      and the like could stand to be beefed up. (Docs are still lousy too,
      alas)

0.06  Thu Mar 11 14:18:23
    - Fixed a boneheaded error in decode_device_bitmaps. (& is bitwise and,
      not &&. Bloody C...)
